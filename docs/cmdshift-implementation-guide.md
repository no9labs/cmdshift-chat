## 💾 Smart Memory Architecture

### 7-Day Rolling Memory System

To avoid ballooning storage costs while maintaining the "AI with memory" value proposition:

```
Memory Tier Structure:
├── 🔥 Hot Memory (0-7 days)
│   ├── Full conversation history in Redis
│   ├── Instant access, no compression
│   ├── Auto-expire after 7 days
│   └── Included in all plans
│
├── 🌡️ Warm Memory (7-30 days) [Pro+]
│   ├── Compressed summaries in PostgreSQL
│   ├── Key points + embeddings in Pinecone
│   ├── Reconstructable context on-demand
│   └── Searchable via semantic search
│
└── 🧊 Cold Storage (30+ days) [Business+]
    ├── S3/R2 object storage (ultra-cheap)
    ├── Searchable via metadata + embeddings
    ├── On-demand retrieval with 2-3s latency
    └── Export capabilities
```

This reduces storage costs by 90% while maintaining perceived value.
